The event creation program is text based, compolsory?
Bitch to create UIs in C
It also seems fairly linear, which is best in procedural programming.
But the event manager is done already?

Checkpoint manager needs a UI (easiest in java). it also needs to represent
many "objects".

needs to represent objects but is text based. would benifit from oo but no
need for UI.
